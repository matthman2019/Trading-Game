                        You can buy and sell things in ports from Italy to China! Certain ports desire items more than others,<br>
                        and your port is no exception! Click the button below that says "homeland details".<br><br><br>
                        
                        I can't force you to click it, but I really recommend it. Your hometown is ${playerShip.city.cityName}, 
                        which as you can see you are in right now. (Look at the location label below).<br>
                        Your job, as a trader, is to take items from your hometown and sell them elsewhere to make profit.<br>
                        In this game profit is represented with points. You gain points by dropping off items you earned at your hometown.<br>
                        Not all items are equal! Most items earn you one point by dropping off,<br>
                        but items in the "desired" list are worth 3 points! Dropping off desired items is the only way to make a net profit overall.<br>
                        You can return other items to your hometown, but they only earn you 1 point.<br><br>

                        To get desired items, you need to go to other cities and trade with them. Some cities will sell items in your "desired" list,<br>
                        But they won't sell them for free! You will have to trade with them. They too have a desired list,<br>
                        and they will offer you more items in trades if you offer them desired items. You don't know their desired list,<br>
                        but on average the further you ship goods, the more likely they are to be desired.<br>
                        Ideally, you want to find a place that desires something your hometown sells (I'll get to that in a minute).<br>
                        Also, most places usually desire <i>something</i> from China (Hangzhou).<br><br>

                        You are a starting merchant. You have a little gold and no items currently.<br>
                        To get items, you need to get them from your hometown. You can see what items your hometown has in the "stock" list.<br>
                        Your hometown will give these items to you without charge, but they decrease your points!<br>
                        Remember, to increase your points you need to drop off items at your hometown. You must to sail to other cities<br>
                        and trade to earn desired items for your hometown. Sail back home and drop them off, and your points will increase!<br>
                        Keep doing this and you will become rich with in-game points. Good luck!
